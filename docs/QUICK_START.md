# Quick Start

Get Bedrock Forge running and manage your first WordPress site in under 5
minutes.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine 24+ and Docker Compose v2+
- `curl` installed (used by the health check in `install.sh`)
- A Linux server you can SSH into (for adding your first managed site)
- 2 GB RAM minimum on the machine running Bedrock Forge

---

## Step 1 — Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satusdev/bedrock-forge.git
cd bedrock-forge
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` does the following automatically:

1. Generates random secrets (`ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`,
   `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`) and writes them
   to `.env`
2. Runs `docker compose build`
3. Starts all services (`docker compose up -d`)
4. Waits for the API health check to pass (`/health`)
5. Seeds the database with roles, default admin user, tags, and starter packages

**Duration:** ~2–4 minutes on first run (Docker build + image pull).

---

## Step 2 — Open the Dashboard

Navigate to **http://localhost:3000**

Log in with the default admin credentials:

| Field    | Value                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@bedrockforge.local` |
| Password | `admin123`                 |

> **Change this password immediately** via Settings → Users after your first
> login.

## Step 3 — Add Your First Server

1. Click **Servers** in the left sidebar
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — friendly label (e.g. `hetzner-cx23-de`)
   - **IP address** — your server's public IP
   - **SSH port** — default `22`
   - **SSH user** — e.g. `root` or `deploy`
   - **SSH private key** — paste your private key (stored encrypted at rest)
   - **Passphrase** — if your key is passphrase-protected
4. Click **Save**

Bedrock Forge tests the SSH connection immediately. If it fails, check the IP,
port, and key.

---

## Step 4 — Add Your First Project & Environment

1. Click **Projects** → **Add Project**
2. Fill in the project name and optionally link a client
3. Open the new project → **Environments** tab → **Add Environment**
4. Fill in:
   - **Type** — `production` (or whatever label makes sense)
   - **Server** — select the server you added in Step 3
   - **URL** — the WordPress site URL (e.g. `https://example.com`)
   - **Root path** — absolute path to the WordPress root on the server (e.g.
     `/home/example.com/public_html`)
   - **Backup path** — where backup archives are stored on the server (e.g.
     `/home/example.com/backups`)
5. Click **Save**

Bedrock Forge will attempt to read WordPress DB credentials from `wp-config.php`
or `.env` in the root path.

---

## Step 5 — Run Your First Backup

1. Open the project → **Backups** tab
2. Click **Create Backup**
3. Select backup type:
   - **Full** — database + files
   - **Database only** — mysqldump only
   - **Files only** — WordPress files, excluding database
4. Click **Start Backup**

Watch real-time progress in the execution log panel. The backup archive is saved
on the server at the configured backup path. If Google Drive is configured in
Settings, it is also uploaded automatically.

---

## Step 6 — Scan Plugins

1. Open the project → **Plugins** tab
2. Click **Scan Plugins**

A minimal PHP script is pushed to the server and executed. Results appear within
seconds showing all installed plugins with name, version, and active/inactive
status.

---

## Step 7 — Set Up Uptime Monitoring

1. Click **Monitors** in the left sidebar → **Add Monitor**
2. Select the environment you want to monitor
3. Set the **interval** (default: 10 minutes)
4. Click **Enable**

The monitor will start checking immediately. You can view response time history
and uptime percentage on the Monitor detail page.

---

## What's Next

- Configure **backup schedules** (daily/weekly/monthly) on the Environment
  detail page
- Add **Google Drive** credentials in **Settings** → **Storage** for off-site
  backup uploads
- Add **Slack notifications** in **Settings** → **Notifications** to get alerted
  on backup failures and site outages
- Add more servers, projects, and clients
- Invite team members via **Users & Roles** (admin only)
