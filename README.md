## What It Is

Bedrock Forge is a single-tenant, self-hosted management platform for WordPress
infrastructure. It is built for operators who manage multiple client sites,
staging/production environments, backups, plugin updates, security checks,
performance audits, and recurring maintenance from one dashboard.

It connects to managed servers over SSH. No permanent agent is installed on the
remote server. Worker jobs push small helper scripts when needed, run the
operation, stream progress back to the UI, and clean up after themselves.

The app is especially useful for CyberPanel-hosted Bedrock projects, but it also
supports standard WordPress layouts for many operations.

## What It Can Do Today

| Area                 | Current capability                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## How It Works

Bedrock Forge runs as a Docker Compose stack:

- `web`: nginx serving the React/Vite dashboard and proxying `/api` and `/ws`
- `forge`: NestJS API plus BullMQ worker runtime
- `postgres`: application database
- `redis`: queues, pub/sub, rate limiting, and realtime job updates

Long-running operations are queued. The API validates and enqueues jobs; the
worker executes remote SSH work and writes step-by-step job logs. The frontend
subscribes to WebSocket updates and polls job execution logs where needed. Job
views show status, elapsed time, progress when available, and the latest worker
step so remote SSH work does not appear stalled.

Remote server access is SSH-native:

- Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM.
- WordPress DB credentials are parsed from `wp-config.php` or Bedrock `.env`
  using regex-based parsing, not shell sourcing.
- Helper PHP scripts are pushed on demand for backup, scan, Composer, custom
  plugin, WP users, and WP action workflows.
- WP-CLI is used for actions where WordPress itself provides the safest API,
  such as theme management, core updates, cache cleanup, and selected plugin
  operations.

## Codebase Structure

This repository is a pnpm/Turborepo TypeScript monorepo:

| Path                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/web`                 | React 19 + Vite dashboard, route pages, layout, UI primitives, API client, WebSocket client, and Zustand/TanStack Query state.           |
| `apps/api`                 | NestJS REST API, JWT/RBAC auth, DTO validation, feature modules, Prisma repositories, job enqueueing, audit logs, and WebSocket gateway. |
| `apps/worker`              | NestJS standalone BullMQ processors for backups, sync, scans, monitoring, reports, notifications, security, and SSH/WP operations.       |
| `packages/shared`          | Shared roles, queue names, job types, WebSocket events, Zod payload schemas, and cross-app TypeScript types.                             |
| `packages/remote-executor` | SSH connection pool, remote command/SFTP execution, and WordPress DB credential parsing.                                                 |
| `prisma`                   | Database schema, migrations, and seed scripts.                                                                                           |
| `docs`                     | Getting started, usage, development, deployment, architecture, and runbook documentation.                                                |

Frontend pages are defined in `apps/web/src/App.tsx` and implemented under
`apps/web/src/pages`. The main workspace pages cover dashboard, clients,
servers, projects, backups, monitors, Lighthouse, activity, problems, settings,
users, packages, invoices, tags, notifications, reports, domains, security,
maintenance windows, and audit logs. Project detail pages include tabs for
environments, backups, sync, restore, plugins, themes, WP core, tools, remote
ops/files/config, drift, and security.

Backend feature modules live under `apps/api/src/modules` and follow
`controller -> service -> repository`. Controllers validate HTTP inputs and
roles, services coordinate business logic, and repositories are the Prisma
boundary. Long-running work is queued through BullMQ and processed by
`apps/worker/src/processors`; shared queue names and payload contracts are kept
in `packages/shared`.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Docker Engine 24+
- Docker Compose v2+
- `curl`
- `openssl`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satusdev/bedrock-forge.git
cd bedrock-forge
./install.sh
```

Production Docker ports:

| URL                            | Purpose          |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `http://localhost:3002`        | Web dashboard    |
| `http://localhost:3001/health` | API health check |

Default seeded admin:

| Field    | Value                      |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| Email    | `admin@bedrockforge.local` |
| Password | `admin123`                 |

Change the admin password immediately after first login.

## Common Workflows

1. Add a server in **Servers** with SSH host, user, port, and private key.
2. Add a client and project in **Clients** or **Projects**.
3. Add one or more environments under the project with URL, root path, backup
   path, and server.
4. Run a backup from **Project -> Backups**.
5. Run a plugin scan from **Project -> Plugins**.
6. Use **Project -> Files & Config** for `.env`, downloads, logs, and notes.
7. Configure monitoring from **Monitors** and security schedules from
   **Security**.
8. Use **Cmd/K** to jump to projects, environments, clients, servers, pages, or
   project tabs.
9. Use **Activity** or the project execution log panel when a queued job needs
   inspection.

See [docs/guides/USAGE.md](docs/guides/USAGE.md) for a fuller operator guide.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
./dev.sh
```

Manual development flow:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
```

Open the dev dashboard at `http://localhost:5173`.

Useful checks:

```bash
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/api lint
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/api test
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/web lint
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/web build
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/worker build
pnpm --filter @bedrock-forge/worker test
```

## Production Operations

```bash
./update.sh          # rebuild/restart Forge and apply migrations
./deploy.sh --cleanup-only # safe Docker image/build-cache cleanup on remote
./reset.sh           # destructive reset: wipes volumes and regenerates secrets
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f forge
```

Deploy/update cleanup prunes unused images and old Docker builder cache after a
healthy deploy. It does not prune volumes. Set `DEPLOY_SKIP_DOCKER_CLEANUP=true`
to skip cleanup, or `DEPLOY_DOCKER_BUILDER_PRUNE_UNTIL=168h` to tune cache age.

Back up both:

- PostgreSQL data, because it stores all records and encrypted credentials.
- `.env`, because `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is required to decrypt stored credentials.
