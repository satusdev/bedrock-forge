# Bedrock CLI Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to build the **Bedrock CLI**, a
Python command-line interface for orchestrating Bedrock-based WordPress
workflows. It covers local project setup with DDEV, server provisioning,
synchronization/backups, deployment, monitoring, CI/CD, and workflow
orchestration. The plan is divided into phases for gradual implementation, with
a checklist to track progress.

## Overview

The Bedrock CLI consolidates tasks for Bedrock WordPress projects into a single
Python CLI (`python -m cli`). It replaces legacy Bash scripts with modular,
cross-platform Python code, supporting local development (DDEV), server
provisioning (Hetzner, CyberPanel), sync/backups (`rclone`), deployment
(`rsync`), monitoring (Uptime Kuma), and CI/CD (Jenkins). This plan ensures a
maintainable, extensible solution with clear steps for implementation.

## Goals and Principles

### Goals

- Create a unified CLI with subcommands: `local`, `provision`, `sync`, `deploy`,
  `monitor`, `ci`, `workflow`.
- Support local project creation/management with DDEV.
- Automate server provisioning, deployment, backups, and monitoring.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux/macOS).
- Centralize configuration and logging.
- Enable extensibility via plugins.
- Include tests and documentation.

### Principles

- **Modularity**: Organize commands in `commands/` (e.g., `local.py`,
  `sync.py`).
- **Phased Approach**: Start with core structure, then add commands
  incrementally.
- **Security**: Use `pydantic` for config validation, `python-dotenv` for env
  vars.
- **User-Friendly**: Support `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, interactive prompts.
- **Maintainability**: Use `pytest` for testing, `structlog` for logging.

## Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Setup and Core Structure (100% Complete)

**Goal**: Establish foundation with CLI entrypoint, utilities, and
configuration.

**Completed Steps**:

- ✅ Created complete directory structure (see [Project Structure](#project-structure))
- ✅ Set up `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
- ✅ Implemented `main.py`, `utils/logging.py`, `utils/errors.py`, `utils/config.py`,
  `utils/shell.py`
- ✅ Created configuration system with `config/default.json` and environment examples
- ✅ Added comprehensive utility modules (security, retry, resilience, API, SSH)
- ✅ Test: `python3 -m forge --help` works perfectly

**Status**: Production ready with comprehensive testing
