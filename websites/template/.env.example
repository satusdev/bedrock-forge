# Example Environment File for a Specific WordPress Site
# This file explains the variables used in the site-specific .env files
# (e.g., websites/site1/.env, websites/site1/.env.development).
# The actual values are set by the create-site.sh script based on templates
# (.env.development.tpl, .env.staging.tpl, .env.production.tpl) and arguments.

# --- Docker Specific ---

# APP_PORT: The local port mapped to the site's Nginx container (port 80 inside).
# Each running site needs a unique port on the host machine.
# Example: APP_PORT=8001
APP_PORT=

# --- Database Credentials ---
# These are unique for each site but connect to the *shared* database service ('db').
# The database and user should be created automatically by create-site.sh --create-db
# or manually within the shared MySQL instance.

# DB_NAME: Name of the database for this specific WordPress site.
# Example: DB_NAME=site1_db
DB_NAME=

# DB_USER: MySQL user granted privileges ONLY for this site's database.
# Example: DB_USER=site1_user
DB_USER=

# DB_PASSWORD: Password for the site-specific MySQL user.
# Example: DB_PASSWORD=a_secure_password
DB_PASSWORD=

# DB_HOST: Hostname of the database service. Should always be 'db' to connect
# to the shared database container defined in core/docker-compose-db.yml.
DB_HOST=db

# DB_ROOT_PASSWORD: This is primarily for reference. The actual root password used
# by the DB container is set via core/docker-compose-db.yml (using core/.env or env var).
# This variable here is NOT used by the DB container itself.
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=

# --- Bedrock Specific ---

# WP_ENV: Sets the environment type (development, staging, production).
# This determines which config file is loaded from www/config/environments/
# and affects things like debugging settings.
# Example: WP_ENV=development
WP_ENV=

# WP_HOME: The public URL for accessing the site's frontend.
# Should match the protocol and port used by the Nginx container.
# Example: WP_HOME=http://localhost:8001
WP_HOME=

# WP_SITEURL: The URL to the WordPress core files directory.
# Typically WP_HOME + /wp for Bedrock setups.
# Example: WP_SITEURL=http://localhost:8001/wp
WP_SITEURL=

# --- WordPress Salts ---
# These MUST be unique for EACH site AND EACH environment (dev, staging, prod).
# The create-site.sh script automatically generates these using the roots.io API.
# Do NOT use the same salts across different environments or sites.
